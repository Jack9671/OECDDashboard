st.subheader("1.1 Background and Motivation")
st.markdown("""
The OECD Dashboard is a comprehensive web-based data visualization platform designed to provide policymakers, researchers, and environmental analysts with intuitive access to critical environmental indicators across OECD member countries. 

**Motivation:**
Environmental policy decisions require evidence-based insights derived from complex datasets spanning multiple decades and countries. Traditional static reports and spreadsheets limit the ability to explore data interactively, identify trends, and make cross-country comparisons effectively.

**Project Scope:**
This dashboard addresses two critical environmental domains:
1. **Greenhouse Gas Output**: Comprehensive analysis of CO2 and other greenhouse gas output with different accounting methods (with/without LULUCF, by sectors, by nature sources)
2. **Nutrient Input/Output**: Agricultural environmental indicators focusing on nutrient flow analysis (Note: Data collection for this topic is ongoing)

**Target Users:**
- International policymakers working on climate agreements
- Environmental researchers and analysts
- Academic institutions studying environmental economics
- NGOs monitoring environmental performance
- Government agencies developing environmental policies
""")

st.subheader("1.2 Visualisation Purpose")
st.markdown("""
The completed visualization empowers users to answer critical environmental policy questions through interactive data exploration.

**Data Cleaning Process:**

**1. Automated Data Discovery and Loading:**
```python
# Recursive CSV file discovery from DataSource folder
csv_files = load_all_csv_files(data_source_path)
for file_path in csv_files:
    relative_path = file_path.relative_to(data_source_path)
    key_name = f"{relative_path.parts[0]}_{relative_path.stem}"
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    dfs[key_name] = df
```

**2. Column Standardization and Selection:**
- Identify and retain only essential columns from ideal set: ['REF_AREA', 'MEASURE', 'UNIT_MEASURE', 'TIME_PERIOD', 'OBS_VALUE', 'UNIT_MULT']
- Remove non-essential metadata columns to focus on analytical data
- Handle missing columns gracefully with fallback to existing structure

**3. Regional Data Filtering:**
- Remove aggregate regional entities (EU27, EU, EU27_2020, EU28) to focus on individual country analysis
- Preserve only OECD member country data for consistent geographical scope
- Validate data coverage across retained countries

**4. Unit Standardization and Scaling:**
- Apply unit multiplier scaling: `OBS_VALUE = OBS_VALUE * (10 ** UNIT_MULT)`
- Convert all values to standard measurement units
- Ensure consistency across different data files and measurement scales

**5. Sector-Specific Data Cleaning:**
- For GreenHouseGasBySectors: Remove '_SECTOR' suffix from MEASURE column
- Replace 'Other sectors' with 'Other' for cleaner categorization
- Standardize sector naming conventions across datasets

**6. Data Safety and Backup:**
- Automatic backup creation (.csv.backup) before any data modification
- Non-destructive processing with original file preservation
- Version tracking through backup timestamps

**Data Processing Statistics:**
- Processed 15+ CSV files across multiple environmental indicator categories
- Retained 6 core columns per dataset for analytical consistency
- Removed EU aggregate regions while preserving 38+ individual OECD countries
- Applied unit scaling to ensure proper numerical representation

**Quality Assurance Measures:**
- Row count validation before and after processing
- Column existence checks before applying transformations
- Error handling for missing files or corrupted data
- Comprehensive logging of all processing steps and outcomes

st.markdown("""
**Design Philosophy:**
The visualization design prioritizes clarity, interactivity, and analytical depth while maintaining accessibility for diverse user groups. The dashboard employs a progressive disclosure approach, allowing users to start with high-level insights and drill down into detailed analysis.

**Core Design Principles:**
1. **User-Centric**: Interface designed for policy analysts and researchers
2. **Data Integrity**: Visualizations accurately represent underlying data
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Easy cross-country and temporal comparisons
4. **Interactive Exploration**: Dynamic filtering and selection capabilities
5. **Professional Aesthetics**: Clean, publication-ready visualizations
""")

st.markdown("""
**Visual Encoding Strategy:**

**Color Coding:**
- **Consistent Country Colors**: Each country maintains the same color across all visualizations
- **Semantic Color Maps**: Diverging colors for positive/negative changes, sequential for magnitudes
- **Accessibility**: Color blind-friendly palettes with sufficient contrast

**Chart Type Selection:**
- **Time Series**: Line charts and area charts for temporal trends
- **Comparisons**: Bar charts and percentage bar charts for country/measure comparisons
- **Geographic Maps**: Choropleth maps with 80+ projection options (static and animated)
- **Distribution Analysis**: Pie charts and tree maps for proportional analysis
- **Multi-dimensional**: Bubble charts for correlation analysis
- **Waterfall Charts**: For environmental factor breakdown analysis
- **Animated Visualizations**: Animated horizontal bar charts and animated maps

**Typography and Layout:**
- **Dynamic Font Sizing**: Automatic adjustment based on chart dimensions (8px-18px range)
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Consistent heading and labeling systems
""")

st.markdown("""
**Iterative Design Evolution:**

**Initial Design (v1.0):**
- Basic line charts and bar charts
- Static color schemes
- Limited interactivity
- Single page layout

**Enhanced Design (v1.5):**
- Added geographic visualizations
- Improved color consistency
- Multi-page navigation
- Basic filtering capabilities

**Current Design (v2.0):**
- **Enhanced Geographic Visualizations**: 80+ map projection types for global visualization
- **Interactive Chart Selection**: Toggle between value/percentage perspectives, line/area charts, pie/tree maps
- **Sunburst Overview Charts**: Visual topic overview with hierarchical structure
- **Modular Architecture**: Reusable chart components in separate modules
- **Smart Filtering System**: "Select All" buttons and session state management
- **Correlation Analysis**: Bubble charts for environmental factor relationships
- **Professional Styling**: Publication-ready chart aesthetics with consistent theming

**Design Justification:**
The multi-projection geographic visualization addresses a critical user need for exploring spatial patterns in greenhouse gas output data across different global perspectives. The toggle-based interface design allows users to switch between analytical views (value vs. percentage, static vs. animated) without cluttering the interface, while the modular chart component architecture ensures maintainability and consistency across visualizations.

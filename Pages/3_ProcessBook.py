st.subheader("1.1 Background and Motivation")
st.markdown("""
The OECD Dashboard is a comprehensive web-based data visualization platform designed to provide policymakers, researchers, and environmental analysts with intuitive access to critical environmental indicators across OECD member countries. 

**Motivation:**
Environmental policy decisions require evidence-based insights derived from complex datasets spanning multiple decades and countries. Traditional static reports and spreadsheets limit the ability to explore data interactively, identify trends, and make cross-country comparisons effectively.

**Project Scope:**
This dashboard addresses two critical environmental domains:
1. **Greenhouse Gas Output**: Comprehensive analysis of CO2 and other greenhouse gas output with different accounting methods (with/without LULUCF, by sectors, by nature sources)
2. **Nutrient Input/Output**: Agricultural environmental indicators focusing on nutrient flow analysis (Note: Data collection for this topic is ongoing)

**Target Users:**
- International policymakers working on climate agreements
- Environmental researchers and analysts
- Academic institutions studying environmental economics
- NGOs monitoring environmental performance
- Government agencies developing environmental policies

st.subheader("1.2 Visualisation Purpose")
st.markdown("""
The completed visualization empowers users to answer critical environmental policy questions through interactive data exploration.

**Data Cleaning Process:**

**1. Automated Data Discovery and Loading:**
```python
# Recursive CSV file discovery from DataSource folder
csv_files = load_all_csv_files(data_source_path)
for file_path in csv_files:
    relative_path = file_path.relative_to(data_source_path)
    key_name = f"{relative_path.parts[0]}_{relative_path.stem}"
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    dfs[key_name] = df
```

**2. Column Standardization and Selection:**
- Identify and retain only essential columns from ideal set: ['REF_AREA', 'MEASURE', 'UNIT_MEASURE', 'TIME_PERIOD', 'OBS_VALUE', 'UNIT_MULT']
- Remove non-essential metadata columns to focus on analytical data
- Handle missing columns gracefully with fallback to existing structure

**3. Regional Data Filtering:**
- Remove aggregate regional entities (EU27, EU, EU27_2020, EU28) to focus on individual country analysis
- Preserve only OECD member country data for consistent geographical scope

**4. Unit Standardization and Scaling:**
- Apply unit multiplier scaling: `OBS_VALUE = OBS_VALUE * (10 ** UNIT_MULT)`
- Convert all values to standard measurement units
- Ensure consistency across different data files and measurement scales

**5. Sector-Specific Data Cleaning:**
- For GreenHouseGasBySectors: Remove '_SECTOR' suffix from MEASURE column
- Replace 'Other sectors' with 'Other' for cleaner categorization
- Standardize sector naming conventions across datasets

**6. Data Safety and Backup:**
- Automatic backup creation (.csv.backup) before any data modification
- Non-destructive processing with original file preservation
- Version tracking through backup timestamps

**Data Processing Statistics:**
- Processed 15+ CSV files across multiple environmental indicator categories
- Retained 6 core columns per dataset for analytical consistency
- Removed EU aggregate regions while preserving 38+ individual OECD countries
- Applied unit scaling to ensure proper numerical representation

**Quality Assurance Measures:**
- Row count validation before and after processing
- Column existence checks before applying transformations
- Error handling for missing files or corrupted data
- Comprehensive logging of all processing steps and outcomes

**3. Regional Filtering and Scope Alignment:**
- EU-level aggregates like 'EU27', 'EU', 'EU28', 'EU27_2020' are removed

**4. Unit Scaling and Numeric Validation:**
- Applied numeric scaling using the UNIT_MULT column to convert observation values to correct magnitude
- Converted OBS_VALUE to numeric, coercing non-numeric entries to NaN

**5. Dataset Consolidation and Merging:**
- Combined all 5 datasets into a single structure (combined) for shared processing
- Individual subsets (inputs, outputs) created using filters and logical grouping

**6. Dynamic User Filtering and Time Selection:**
- Year range selection added via Streamlit slider
- Data filtered dynamically based on year range and user interaction

**Iterative Design Evolution:**

**Initial Design (v1.0):**
- Basic line charts and bar charts
- Static color schemes
- Limited interactivity
- Single page layout

**Enhanced Design (v1.5):**
- Added geographic visualizations
- Improved color consistency
- Multi-page navigation
- Basic filtering capabilities

**Current Design (v2.0):**
- **Enhanced Geographic Visualizations**: 80+ map projection types for global visualization
- **Interactive Chart Selection**: Toggle between value/percentage perspectives, line/area charts, pie/tree maps
- **Sunburst Overview Charts**: Visual topic overview with hierarchical structure

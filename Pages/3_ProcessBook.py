st.subheader("1.1 Background and Motivation")
st.markdown("""
The OECD Dashboard is a comprehensive web-based data visualization platform designed to provide policymakers, researchers, and environmental analysts with intuitive access to critical environmental indicators across OECD member countries. 

**Motivation:**
Environmental policy decisions require evidence-based insights derived from complex datasets spanning multiple decades and countries. Traditional static reports and spreadsheets limit the ability to explore data interactively, identify trends, and make cross-country comparisons effectively.

**Project Scope:**
This dashboard addresses two critical environmental domains:
1. **Greenhouse Gas Output**: Comprehensive analysis of CO2 and other greenhouse gas output with different accounting methods (with/without LULUCF, by sectors, by nature sources)
2. **Nutrient Input/Output**: Agricultural environmental indicators focusing on nutrient flow analysis (Note: Data collection for this topic is ongoing)

**Target Users:**
- International policymakers working on climate agreements
- Environmental researchers and analysts
- Academic institutions studying environmental economics
- NGOs monitoring environmental performance
- Government agencies developing environmental policies
""")

st.subheader("1.2 Visualisation Purpose")
st.markdown("""
The completed visualization empowers users to answer critical environmental policy questions through interactive data exploration.
